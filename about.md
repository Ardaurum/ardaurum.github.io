**Hey you!** I’m Radek, nice to meet you. As a kid I always wanted to make video games and as an adult I can proudly say that I haven’t let my past self down. I love working on graphics and tools, although I had to wear many hats from Shaders, Tools, Software Architecture to UI, Audio Programming and being a Team Lead.

I got a degree in Computer Science at Poznań University Of Technology and immediately after that I started working at Blindflug Studios creating several indie games working with many technologies and platforms. Currently I'm working at PixelAnt Games polishing my graphic programming skills.
